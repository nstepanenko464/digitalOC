# Merging data from participation files with some run data

# From participation:
#	offense formation
#	offense personnel

# From pbp data:
#	make sure play type is a run
#	run location
#	run gap
#	yards_gained
#	epa

# Have to filter these from the data
# Pull them out, and then merge them together into a dataframe using play_id and game_id
#	Will probably have to use old_game_id, since participation data has no 'game_id'
